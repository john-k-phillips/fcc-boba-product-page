<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project was a fun one, using the lovely design of boba tea, I decided to create a colourful layout for this webpage.
  
  I originally had images displayed on here; however, because they were ripped from unsplash with edits, I felt they didn't fit this page, so I instead removed them.
  Although; looking back, I could have used a template image to showcase the location.
